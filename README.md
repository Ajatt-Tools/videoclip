Easily create video and audio clips with mpv in a few keypresses.
Videoclips are saved as `.mp4` or `.webm`.
Subtitles can be embedded into the clips.

## Prerequisites

1) [Install mpv](https://mpv.io/installation/).
2) Add the directory where `mpv` is installed
   to the [PATH](https://www.mojeek.com/search?q=path+variable).

   If you're using GNU/Linux, this step is likely unnecessary
   because package managers (`apt`, `pacman`, etc.)
   place executable files to `/usr/bin` which is already added to the `PATH`.
   If you have installed `mpv` to a non-standard location,
   or if you're not using the GNU operating system,
   you need to make sure that `mpv` is added to the `PATH`.

## Installation

### Using git

Clone the repository to the `mpv/scripts` directory.
The command below works on the GNU operating system with `git` installed.

``` bash
git clone 'https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/videoclip.git' ~/.config/mpv/scripts/videoclip
```

To update the user-script on demand later, you can execute:

``` bash
cd ~/.config/mpv/scripts/videoclip && git pull
```

### Manually

Download
[the repository](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/videoclip/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
and extract the folder containing
`videoclip.lua`
to your [mpv scripts](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts) directory:

| OS | Location |
| --- | --- |
| GNU/Linux | `~/.config/mpv/scripts/` |
| Windows | `C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/scripts/` |

Note: in [Celluloid](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/celluloid/)
user scripts are installed by switching to the "Plugins" tab
in the preferences dialog and dropping the files there.

<summary>Expected directory tree</summary>

```
~/.config/mpv/scripts
|-- other_addon_1
|-- other_addon_2
`-- videoclip
    |-- main.lua
    |-- ...
    `-- videoclip.lua
```

</details>

## Configuration

The config file should be created by the user, if needed.

| OS | Config location |
| --- | --- |
| GNU/Linux | `~/.config/mpv/script-opts/videoclip.conf` |
| Windows | `C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/script-opts/videoclip.conf` |

If a parameter is not specified in the config file, the default value will be used.
mpv doesn't tolerate spaces before and after `=`.

Example configuration file:

```
# Absolute paths to the folders where generated clips will be placed.
# `~` is supported, but environment variables (e.g. `$HOME`) are not supported due to mpv limitations.
video_folder_path=~/Videos
audio_folder_path=~/Music

# Menu size
font_size=24

# OSD settings. Line alignment: https://aegisub.org/docs/3.2/ASS_Tags/#\an
osd_align=7
osd_outline=1.5

# Clean filenames (remove special characters) (yes or no)
clean_filename=yes

# Video settings
video_width=-2
video_height=480
video_bitrate=1M
# Available video formats: mp4, vp9, vp8
video_format=mp4
# The range of the scale is 0â€“51, where 0 is lossless,
# 23 is the default, and 51 is worst quality possible.
# Insane values like 9999 still work but produce the worst quality.
video_quality=23
# Use the slowest preset that you have patience for.
# https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264
preset=faster
# FPS / framerate. Set to "auto" or a number.
video_fps=auto
#video_fps=60

# Audio settings
# Available formats: opus or aac
audio_format=opus
# Opus sounds good at low bitrates 32-64k, but aac requires 128-256k.
audio_bitrate=32k

# Catbox.moe upload settings
# Whether uploads should go to litterbox instead of catbox.
# catbox files are stored permanently, while litterbox is temporary
litterbox=yes
# If using litterbox, time until video expires
# Available values: 1h, 12h, 24h, 72h
litterbox_expire=72h

# Filename format
# Available tags: %n = filename, %t = title, %s = start, %e = end, %d = duration,
#                 %Y = year, %M = months, %D = day, %H = hours (24), %I = hours (12),
#                 %P = am/pm %N = minutes, %S = seconds
# Title will fallback to filename if it's not present
#filename_template=%n_%s-%e(%d)
filename_template=%n_%s-%e
```

### Key bindings

| OS | Config location |
| --- | --- |
| GNU/Linux | `~/.config/mpv/input.conf` |
| Windows | `C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/input.conf` |

Add this line if you want to change the key that opens the script's menu.

```
c script-binding videoclip-menu-open
```

## Usage

- Open a file in mpv and press `c` to open the script menu.
- Follow the onscreen instructions. You need to set the `start point`,
`end point`, and then press `c` to create the clip.

It is possible to create silent videoclips.
To do that, first mute audio in mpv.
The default key binding is `m`.

If a video has visible subtitles, they will be embedded automatically.
Toggle them off in mpv if you don't want any subtitles to be visible.
The default key binding is `v`.
